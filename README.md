# Churn Prediction in the Waze App: Leveraging Feature Engineering and Machine Learning Models

**Overview**
* This project predicts user churn in the Waze app using tree-based models, focusing on key factors and retention strategies.
  
**Activity Structure**

*1. Ethical Considerations
  * Address biases and fairness in predicting churn.
    
*2. Feature Engineering
  * Develop features to enhance model performance.
    
*3. Modeling
  * Build, tune, and compare machine learning models.
  * Investigate optimal decision thresholds and feature importance.
    
**Summary**

*1. Objective
  * Predict user churn and identify contributing factors.
    
*2. Insights
  * Ensure fairness and address biases.
  * Mitigate risks of missed churns and unnecessary retention efforts.
    
*3. Recommendation
  * Use the model as a decision-support tool for retention strategies.

**Packages Used**
* `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation.
* `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn` for visualizations.
* `sklearn`, `xgboost` for modeling and evaluation.
